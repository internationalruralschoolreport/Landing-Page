Team contribution:
- My team had only 3 people 1 frontend, 1 backend, UI Dev (me). Our frontend person ghosted on us completed so we didn't have one until wednesday for a while hence I wasn't able to collaborate until Wednesday. Still we slacked back and forth to figure out a cohesive color scheme and were able to finish MVP.

My project: 
- I was tasked with building out the landing and about pages for an app allows school administrators in the developing world to track and broadcast the needs of their school to board members in the US. 

HTML/CSS:
- I used flexbox for both the marketing and about pages and they especially came in handy for responsiveness. I used Unsplash to get photos for the site.

Responsiveness:
- For this desktop first site, I also built responsiveness at 500px max-width. At this width, most of the flexboxes were stacked as columns instead of rows for ease of vertical scrolling. 

JavaScript: 
- The main place where I used Javascript/DOM manipulation was in building out components for our bios on the About page. Inside each bio card, the headshot and title are always visible with a button below the headshot that toggles into our bio and github + linkedin pages.
